        <!-- This is my backbone app, they all do the same thing but I wanted to give a 
        flavor for how jQuery, Angular, and Backbone are all different.  In this case I might not 
        typically have an id saying bb-app I often only have <body></body> as my base html for a backbone app.
        Unlike Angular (which is http extended to be dynamic) Backbone is all about 
        rendering.  The views can render themselves into off-screen elements for fast page loading.
    
        Here I chose to have a basic ul tag to really launch from.

        Like Angular both apps have an element that the app has domain over.
